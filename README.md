# Modeling-with-Graphs
* **greedy_algorithm_basic.py** :
	*Implementation of a basic greedy algorithm. This file contains two functions, find_smallest_color and greedy. find_smallest_color  returns the colour to be assigned to the currently visited node.
* **greedy_algorithm_variation.py** :
	* Implementation of a greedy algorithm. The algorithm instead of visiting the nodes sequentially is always choosing the adjacent node of the previously visited node.
* **breadth_first.py** :
	*Implementation of a breadth first search.
* **depth_first_pair_nodes.py.** :
	* Implementation of a depth first search
* **find_diameter.py** :
	* The algorithm finds the diameter of  a graph.
